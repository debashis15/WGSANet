WGSANet: Wavelet-Gradient Synergistic Attentive Fusion Network
Welcome to the official repository for WGSANet, a novel image denoising model that integrates Wavelet-Gradient Synergistic Attentive Fusion to achieve superior denoising performance.

Abstract
Image denoising remains a critical challenge in computer vision, impacting fields such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and photography. Despite significant progress in deep learning, existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) face persistent issues, including training complexities and insufficient consideration of gradient information. Moreover, the potential of wavelet-domain feature extraction in image denoising remains largely unexplored.

This study introduces WGSANet, a pioneering wavelet-gradient synergistic attentive fusion network for image denoising. WGSANet combines two complementary pipelines:

A Wavelet-Domain Processing Pipeline (WDP) utilizing discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for multi-level image decomposition, processed by a Multi-Scale Attention Aggregator Block (MSAAB) to enhance high-frequency sub-band features.
A Gradient-Based Processing Pipeline (GBPP) that captures multidirectional gradient information for improved edge and detail preservation.
Experimental results demonstrate that WGSANet outperforms existing methods, showing robust performance across diverse datasets. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of each pipeline, highlighting the novel synergy of wavelet and gradient-based features.

The source code and further details are available in the repository.
