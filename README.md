WGSANet: Wavelet-Gradient Synergistic Attentive Fusion Network

Welcome to the official repository for WGSANet, a novel image denoising model that integrates Wavelet-Gradient Synergistic Attentive Fusion to achieve superior denoising performance.

Abstract
Image denoising remains a critical challenge in computer vision, with applications spanning medical imaging, remote sensing, and photography. Despite significant progress in deep learning, current convolutional neural networks (CNNs) still face training complexities due to increased network depth and neglect important gradient information. Moreover, existing approaches have not fully explored the potential of wavelet-domain feature extraction in image denoising.

This study addresses these limitations with WGSANet, a pioneering wavelet-gradient synergistic attentive fusion network. WGSANet integrates two distinct pathways:

A Wavelet-Domain Processing Pipeline (WDP) that utilizes discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for multi-level decomposition, enhanced by a Multi-Scale Attention Aggregator Block (MSAAB) to process high-frequency sub-band features.
A Gradient-Based Processing Pipeline (GBPP) that captures image gradients from multiple directions to improve edge preservation and detail retention.
WGSANet achieves outstanding denoising results, outperforming existing methods across multiple datasets. Ablation studies reveal the critical contributions of each component, showcasing the novel synergy between wavelet and gradient-based features.

The source code and further details are available in the repository.
